# text_restyle
I use the copilot chat to test how it might be used to generate from and transform an older text into a 1990s themed blog post sample. The purpose is to enable a reader to explore the older text through a different lens to make it more apepaling. 
The process is documented through screenshots which show the prompts and responses.

This was successful as a test, but it required a lot of prompting involvement from me. It could be more automated by building an application which uses agents to more independently curate and edit the text.


NOTES:
I didn't edit/correct any of the generated text. 
I copy-pasted the HTML as generated into a notepad file and saved it as .html
The only edit I did was finding and pasting a source for the rose image GIF becuase copilot was not able to do this succssesfully.
